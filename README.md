# LIT REVIEW

**Version 1.0**


# Project Configuration

## Pull the project from github 
	
- After getting access to the github repository, pull the project with the following command :
	```python 	
	git clone https://github.com/MiladEzame/lit_review.git
	```
## Creating a virtual environment to run the API

- Python installation is required for the following process. You can download Python on python.org.
Python3 includes venv that allows us to create a virtual environment very easily.
To make sure there is no problem in the process, you can still install the virtual environment package
using this command : 
	```python 	
	pip install virtualenv
	```
	
- To create a new virtual environment called __environment_name__, write the following command line in your windows command prompt : 
	```python
	python -m venv environment_name
	```
	
## Activate/Deactivate virtual environment

- Once you've created the virtual environment, you have to activate it.
	On __Windows__, type the following command :
	```python	
	./environment_name/Scripts/activate
	```
	On __Unix__ or __MacOS__, type the following command:
	```python 		
	source environment_name/bin/activate
	```
	If you have any difficulties, please refer to this page : https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html
	
	Once you are done, you can simply __deactivate__ by using the following command :
	```python 		
	deactivate
	```

## Run Server

- Once you've created the virtual environment, you have to start the API by using the following command :
	```python 		
	python manage.py runserver
	```

## Run the index.html file
